# GREAT â­‘ BEAR
Food delivery sample application metarepo (PostgreSQL / GraphQL / React).

### What this is
* fair comparison between Hasura, PostGraphile, and Prisma 
  * why these 3 technologies (why graphql)?
  * why is a food delivery website the best app to build?
  * how is it fair?  
* keep best practices wrt security, frontend tech
  * cookies
  * react hooks - not everything yet
  * styled-components - keeps css near the js, parent-enforces-child-bounds
* postgresql
  * denormalized database - don't prematurely optimise
  * camel_case vs snakeCase
  * auditability
  * security, speed, etc. etc. its good database mmmmkay?
* aim for the absolute bare minimum of backend boilerplate
